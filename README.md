# Glen's Quest
This code represents an initial attempt at re-implementing the Kyle's Quest game engine from the early PalmPilot days in Python 3. I may get around to finishing this... some day...

## Installation
The only library dependency is pygame

## Getting Started
You will need a pdb file of a Kyle's Quest game. If you look around using the Internet Archive you can find a few levels, and even a level editor to make your own.

displaytest.py and displaytestmainmap.py are the only scripts that produce anything visible. Both take the PDB file as the first argument.

displaytest.py lets you "walk" around the map using the arrow keys.

```
python .\displaytest.py somegame.pdb
```

## Disclaimer
This is ~~probably~~ definitely written rather poorly. Run at your own risk.
